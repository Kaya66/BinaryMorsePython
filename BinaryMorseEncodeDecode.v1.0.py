#Little explination on how the binary / morse code system works
#in morse, you can write out any standard letters and numbers with a max of 5 dots or dashes.
#in binary we have 8 digits that are addrssable in a byte.
#split up a byte into 5 and 3.   00000 / 000
#the 3 on the right tell you how many digits on the left you need to pay attention to.
#The letter C written out in this method would be 01010100    01010 / 100
#0 = dash
#1 = dot
#the three digits on the right read out 4 so you read the 5 on the left starting left to right.  and read the first 4.
# -.-.   = C
#any trailing zero's past what you need to pay attention to can be safely ignored.
#i may go back later and use the 2 extra numbers i have in the right 3 bits to add extra stuff such as periods, commas, and such.
